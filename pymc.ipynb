    "## Fitting a model? \n",
    "Fitting a model means characterizing its posterior distribution somehow. In this case, we are trying to represent the posterior p(s,e,l|D) by a set of joint samples from it. To produce these samples, the MCMC sampler randomly updates the values of switchpoint, early_mean and late_mean according to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [Gelman2004] over a specified number of iterations (iter).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of samples grows sufficiently large, the MCMC distributions of switchpoint, early_mean and late_mean converge to their joint stationary distribution. In other words, their values can be considered as random draws from the posterior p(s,e,l|D). PyMC assumes that the burn parameter specifies a sufficiently large number of iterations for the algorithm to converge, so it is up to the user to verify that this is the case (see chapter Model checking and diagnostics). Consecutive values sampled from switchpoint, early_mean and late_mean are always serially dependent, since it is a Markov chain. MCMC often results in strong autocorrelation among samples that can result in imprecise posterior inference. To circumvent this, it is useful to thin the sample by only retaining every k th sample, where k\n",
    "k is an integer value. This thinning interval is passed to the sampler via the thin argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not sure ahead of time what values to choose for the burn and thin parameters, you may want to retain all the MCMC samples, that is to set burn=0 and thin=1, and then discard the burn-in period and thin the samples after examining the traces (the series of samples). See [Gelman2004] for general guidance.\n",
